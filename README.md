# Overview

This repository contains code for a semester project exploring the Opioid crisis & the factors affecting the metabolism of oxycodone. Specifically, I created several exploratory visualizations and modeling drug metabolism using ordinary differential equations in Python.

An overview of results can be seen [here](./Metabolism_of_Oxycodone.pdf).

A deeper dive into the code behind the plots can be seen [here](./Final_Code.ipynb).
